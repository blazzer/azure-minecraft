# Install Minecraft PE on an Ubuntu Virtual Machine


This template deploys and sets up a customized Minecraft PE server on an Ubuntu Virtual Machine, with you as the operator. It also deploys a Virtual Network, Network Security Group, Public IP address and a Network Interface.

You can set common Minecraft server properties as parameters at deployment time. Once the deployment is successful you can connect to the DNS address of the VM with a Minecraft Windows 10 Edition launcher. 

The following Minecraft server configuration parameters can be set at deployment time: Minecraft user name, difficulty, level-name, gamemode, white-list, enable-command-block, spawn-monsters, generate-structures, level-seed.
